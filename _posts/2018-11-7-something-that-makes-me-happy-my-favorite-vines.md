#### As you can tell by the title we are going to talk about my favorite vines! but first lets talk about what makes a good vine.

## what Makes A Good Vine?

a good vine is created out of no where, its like chance. being at the right place at the right time. its funny becuase its so stupidly random. or the setting, maybe how the person looks.

the man says "road work ahead, uh yeah. i sure hope it does." it so stupid and simple that people now reference it.
