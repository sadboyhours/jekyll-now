## why dogs make me happy

They all come in different shapes and sizes and colors. They all are something to give love to, whether they give it back or not they make me happy. They act so stupid as puppies and really cute when they start running and playing. And when they get old they love you, forever. They act really crazy and cute when they hear their bag of treats. And i don't know why but them just existing is enough for me to be happy.

In conclusion they make me happy because they just emit happiness, and love and everything kind in the world.

## my favorite dogs

Literally all of them through them all on me i love them all. All dogs literally make me cry out of joy and sadness that i cant keep them. So what the pilot of this paragraph if i'm not going to name what my favorite dogs are?

Well i actually do have a favorite dog. But there's a lot and maybe it's because i know what breed they are. So let's start with my first fav dog.

Pomeranian and pekingese mix
Maltese and poodle mix
Husky and pomeranian mix
Pugs!
Doberman
Rottweiler
Bulldogs
And literally all of them

## oof idk what to say now

By the end of this post i guess all i really wanted to say was dogs make me happy and i really do love them with all my heart and one day when i move out im getting either a pug or a husky and moving to a flat with them and live happy being a starving artists with two dogs. And living a with my niece whos going to have two cats. Idk how it's going to work but it'll be fine.
